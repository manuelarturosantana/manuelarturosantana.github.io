# Welcome!

My name is Manuel Santana (pronounced Man-well, not Manual, or Man-u-well). Feel free to call my Manni! I am a PhD Candidate at the California Insititute of technology 
in the Applied and Computational Mathematics porgram currently under the advisement of [Professor Oscar Bruno](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/obruno). I am interested in numerical analysis, wave equation solvers, scientific computing, and scientific machine learning.
