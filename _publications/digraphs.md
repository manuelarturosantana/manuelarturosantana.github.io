Abstract: A (0, 1)-labelling of a set is said to be friendly if approximately one half the elements of the set are
labelled 0 and one half labelled 1. Let g be a labelling of the edge set of a graph that is induced by a
labelling f of the vertex set. If both g and f are friendly then g is said to be a cordial labelling of the
graph. We extend this concept to directed graphs and investigate the cordiality of sets of directed
graphs. We investigate a specific type of cordiality on digraphs, a restriction of quasigroup-cordiality
called (2, 3)-cordiality. A directed graph is (2, 3)-cordial if there is a friendly labelling f of the vertex
set which induces a (1, −1, 0)-labelling of the arc set g such that about one third of the arcs are
labelled 1, about one third labelled -1 and about one third labelled 0. In particular we determine
which tournaments are (2, 3)-cordial, which orientations of the n-wheel are (2, 3)-cordial, and which
orientations of the n−fan are (2, 3)-cordial.
