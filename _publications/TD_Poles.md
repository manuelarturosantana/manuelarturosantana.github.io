Abstract: Fourier-transform-based methods enable accurate, dispersion-free simulations of time-domain scattering problems by evaluating
solutions to the Helmholtz equation at a discrete set of frequencies, sufficient to approximate the inverse Fourier
transform. However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles, the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex
resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces
a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently
computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a straight forward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a
large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational
approximation of integral equation solutions at real frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all
relevant complex resonances are properly identified.
