Thanks to my advisor Oscar Bruno and our collaborator Nick Trefethen at Harvard for all the great work. The image on the left is the total field for a circle with a cavity at high wave number, and the image on the right is the eigenfunction corresponding to a complex eigenvalue of the Laplacian near the wave number for the incident wave of the left image.
