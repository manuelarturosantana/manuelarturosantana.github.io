Hi, I'm Manuel Santana (pronounced *Man-well*â€”not *[Manual](https://youtu.be/XxZGYjU1PRc?si=qR4RiDRTO0uN1L7m)* or *Man-u-well* ðŸ˜„). You can call me Mani!  

I'm a PhD student in the Applied and Computational Mathematics program at the California Institute of Technology, where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by [Professor Oscar Bruno](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/obruno).  

My research interests lie broadly in numerical analysis and computational science, with a particular focus on numerical methods for wave scattering problems, rational approximation, and nonlinear eigenvalue problems.  

So far, my PhD work has centered on combining boundary integral equations with rational approximation to efficiently compute Laplace eigenvalues. I've also been applying these methods to tackle time-domain scattering problems.  

Thanks for coming, have an xkcd comic!
