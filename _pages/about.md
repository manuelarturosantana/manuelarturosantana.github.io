My name is Manuel Santana (pronounced Man-well, not Manual, or Man-u-well). Feel free to call me Mani! I am a PhD student at the California Insititute of Technology 
in the Applied and Computational Mathematics program currently under the advisement of [Professor Oscar Bruno](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/obruno). I am interested in broadly in numerical analysis and computational science, and specifically in numerical methods for wave scattering problems, rational approximation, and nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Thanks for coming, have an xkcd comic.
