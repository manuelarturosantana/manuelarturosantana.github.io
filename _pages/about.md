My name is Manuel Santana (pronounced Man-well, not Manual, or Man-u-well). Feel free to call me Mani! I am a PhD Candidate at the California Insititute of Technology 
in the Applied and Computational Mathematics program currently under the advisement of [Professor Oscar Bruno](https://eas.caltech.edu/people/obruno). I am interested in numerical analysis, numerical methods for scattering, and scientific machine learning. Thanks for coming, have an xkcd comic.
