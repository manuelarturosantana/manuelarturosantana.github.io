Lead four recitations a week for an introductory linear algebra course and held office hours. I also created a jupyter notebook to demonstrate image compression using singular value decomposition. Major topics included solving linear systems, projections, orthogonal basises, eigenvalues, diagonalization, singular value decomposition, and general linear operators.
